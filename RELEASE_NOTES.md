# Release Notes - Packagemaker Build 2025.12.09

We are excited to announce a major update to **Packagemaker**, bringing professional-grade packaging and a revamped user experience.

## 🌟 Highlights

### ⚡ Professional Compilation
We have integrated a full-featured compiler powered by **PyInstaller**.
- Your scripts are no longer just zipped; they are compiled into standalone executables.
- Automatic dependency handling and asset inclusion.
- Supports both Windows and Linux targets.

### 🎨 Visual & UI Overhaul
- **Fluent & Modern**: Experience the new UWP-style focus indicators.
- **Better Layouts**: The creation form is cleaner, aligned, and easier to use.
- **Real-time**: The project manager allows you to see changes instantly without hitting refresh.

### 🛠️ Developer Quality of Life
- **Recursive Autocomplete**: Finding your project to build is faster than ever.
- **Icon Support**: Easily brand your apps with custom icons right from the creation screen.
- **Embedded Updater**: The self-updating logic is now built-in, making your generated projects more portable.

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- **Dependencies**: Ensure you have `pyinstaller` installed (`pip install pyinstaller`).
- **Python Path**: If script execution fails, ensure Python is added to your system PATH. Packagemaker now tries to auto-detect it smarter than before.
